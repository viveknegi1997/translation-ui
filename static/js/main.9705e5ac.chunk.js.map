I, Ye Gulou have become the first person to cultivate immortality through pure unbounded Yang. But wait, cultivating pure unbounded Yang means I can't form relationships with women or else I'll die?! Then what can I do about this harem of mine that's grown so large over the years? They're all chasing me down, coercing me to choose between them (otherwise they'll kill Me). They've forced me to ascend to the Heavens, to immortality right now to escape from their wrath. Oh shit, they followed me to the new world?!! Let's see what awaits us as my harems from both worlds combine!\"\n    }\n};","import React from 'react';\nimport Card from 'react-bootstrap/Card'\n\nimport { Col, Row, Container } from
