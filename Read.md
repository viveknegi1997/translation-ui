In short:
If you have multiple Routes, that match the path, all of them will be displayed.
If you have a Switch around the Routes, only the first matching Route will be displayed


hooks can only be used inside function components not inside class

If you use gh-pages for React app deployment â€“ just put CNAME file with your domain into public folder.
